# SVM Model for Binary Classification

This repository contains the trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (`best_svm_model.pkl`) for binary classification tasks.

## Overview

The SVM model was trained using scikit-learn library in Python. It is trained to perform binary classification on a dataset containing features and labels. The model is optimized using grid search with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.

## File Description

- `best_svm_model.pkl`: This is the serialized version of the trained SVM model. It can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

## Usage

1. **Loading the Model**: You can load the trained SVM model using any Python environment with scikit-learn installed. Here's a sample code snippet to load the model:

    ```python
    import joblib

    # Load the model
    model = joblib.load('best_svm_model.pkl')
    ```

2. **Making Predictions**: Once the model is loaded, you can use it to make predictions on new data. Ensure that the new data is preprocessed in the same way as the training data.

    ```python
    # Assuming X_new contains the new data
    predictions = model.predict(X_new)
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn library
